# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This module is a generic key/value store for storing configuration data that should be shared among terraform root
  modules. It is designed to have a swappable backend, so it can be used with any AWS service that would support
  this type of storage. The initial version supports AWS SSM Parameter Store with S3 and DynamoDB as future backends.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl

  module "example" {
    source  = "cloudposse/kv-store/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    write = {
      "key1" = {value = "value1", sensative = false }
      "key2" = {value = "value2", sensative = true }
    }
